# Define the program you'd like to use to reproduce youtube
# Options:
# 1) vlc
#   I use nvlc ( ncurses interface ) to keep everything on the terminal.
#   If you use vlc, a Window is launched to play the stream/file.
#   If you want the player to quit after finishing the strem, use the --play-and-exit 
#   argument.
#   If you don't want the player to launch a video window, yse the --no-video argument.
# 2) ffplay
#   Works fantastically, but does not allow to skip ahead and has to be cancelled 
#   with CTRL+C to return to the menus.
